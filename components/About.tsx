            I created this breathing timer because I often have anxious moments, and I wanted a simple, plug-and-play tool 
            to help me calm down. Nothing complicatedâ€”just an easy way to guide my breathing when I needed it.

            The default setting is the <strong>4-4-4</strong> method (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds), 
            but you can customize it to fit what works best for you. Just breathe and let the timer do the rest.

            If it helps even one person feel a little more in control during stressful moments, then it was worth making.
